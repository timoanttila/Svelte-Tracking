# Svelte Reactive Google Analytics

In marketing, it is very important that the website owner is able to track visitor's movements.

Normally, one can just add Google or Facebook script to the main html or php page, but Sapper's and Routify's navigation by a viewer happens in the frontend, besides the initial load and page refreshes. Page views are not registered and paths are not updated to those tracking scripts.

But there's no reason to worry, because we can easily fix that problem by making a component or two which updates the tracking scripts.
